# This script creates two kinds of isometric cameras.
#The one, TrueIsocam called camera, is the mathematical correct isometric camera with the 54.736 rotation to get the 30 degrees angles at the sides of the rhombus.
#The other, GameIsocam called camera, is a camera with which you can render isometric tiles for a 2d game. Here we need a 60 degrees angle instedad of the 54.736 one to get a proper stairs effect and a ratio of 2:1
# Then there is the special case with a 4:3 ratio, which is button 3. You can also make 2D games with that one. The view is more topdown though as with a 2:1 ratio of the traditional game iso view.
# The fourth button creates a simple groundplane where you can place your stuff at.

#You can of course set up everything by hand. This script is a convenient solution so that you don't have to setup it again and again.
